[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/KDr2/JetAlpha.jl.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/KDr2/JetAlpha.jl)

JetAlpha is a playground for julians, mostly for fun and exploring the Julia language.

It has a simple Bot interface for slack and(or) pubu.im, you can join the channel
`JetAlpha` on [julia.pubu.im](https://julia.pubu.im/reg/8n4bwmmlkym8c98 "PUBU IM") to
discuss about and play with JetAlpha.

[Join julia.pubu.im](https://julia.pubu.im/reg/8n4bwmmlkym8c98 "PUBU IM") and say
hello to JetAlpha now.

It also has a web interface at http://jetalpha.org/, but it's just a simple page
so far.

## Features

### Slack/Pubu Bot

- cmd `calc`: do simple arithmetic evaluation, e.g.: `jet, calc 1+2*3/4`
- cmd `doc`: show document for julia object, e.g.: `jet, doc exit`

## Roadmap

No Roadmap now, but [see TODO'S here](https://github.com/KDr2/JetAlpha.jl/blob/master/TODO.md "TODO'S").

## Contributing

It's a playground as mentioned, so just play it!
No more rules except the convention of the julia community.

[Join julia.pubu.im](https://julia.pubu.im/reg/8n4bwmmlkym8c98 "PUBU IM") to ask anything
freely if you are not sure.
